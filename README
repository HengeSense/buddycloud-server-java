THE master branch IS VERY SOON GOING TO BE CLEANED UP.

New version is soon going to pushed which will have a much cleaner skeleton + plus documentation about the skeleton of the code and how functional tests can be done.

The goal is that it'll be much easier for others to collaborate (and teach me Java). 

Almost all the bc functionalities will be missing and the rest will have bugs, so don't expect to run it yet as a main bc channel server.
