# Buddycloud Java Server implementation

Note: This server is not as fully featured as the nodejs server https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server.

Currently the server has enough features that it is usable. It federates with remote servers but does not currently cache posts i.e. every time you make a request from a remote node you're acutally getting data from the remote server.
